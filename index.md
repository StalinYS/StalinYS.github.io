## About me

I'm a third year student in BSU (School of Business). My specialization is Information Resource Management. As my education is connected with programming and economics both, I decided to focus more on my technical skills and went to EPAM Systems training program as a .NET developer.

I studied in the USA (Troy University) for half a year as an exchange student

### Projects

1. Made a website for a company that provides foreign language courses using HTML/CSS (exam project)
2. Participated in VandyHacks hackathon
3. Made a descktop application for document generation as a research paper project
4. Made a website for posting labs using ASP.NET

### Interests

- **MOOCing** - always search for online courses to improve my knowledge
- **Learning about new languages and cultures** - I travel a lot and I've been to 12 countries so far, lived in another country for half a year and I maintain this passion for exploring 
- **Volleyball and yoga** - Sport is an essential part of my daily life but these kinds are my favorite ones
